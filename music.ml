(*......................................................................
Problem 3.1: Write a function `list_to_stream` that builds a music
stream from a finite list of musical objects. The stream should repeat
this music forever. (In order for the output to be well defined, the
input list must have at least one note. You can assume as much.) Hint:
Use a recursive auxiliary function `list_to_stream_aux` as shown
below, which will call itself recursively on the list allowing you to
keep keep the original list around as well. Both need to be recursive,
since you will call both the inner and outer functions at some
point. See below for some examples.

streams. Events that happen earlier in time should appear earlier in
the merged stream. See below for some examples.

Problem 3.3: Write a function `transpose` that takes an event stream
and moves each pitch up by `half_steps` pitches. Note that
`half_steps` can be negative, but this case is particularly difficult
to reason about so we've implemented it for you. See below for some
examples.

  let newp = (p_to_int p) + half_steps in

(* ... UNCOMMENT THIS SECTION ONCE YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED 
                 THE FUNCTIONS ABOVE. ... *)

(*......................................................................
For testing purposes, let's start with a trivial example, useful for
checking list_to_stream, transpose, and pair functions. Start with a
simple melody1: *)

let melody1 = list_to_stream [quarter (C,3);
                              quarter_rest;
                              half (E,3)] ;;

(* This melody, when converted to a stream of start and stop events,
should look something like this:

    # NLS.first 5 melody1 ;;
    - : event list =
    [Tone (0., (C, 3), 60); Stop (0.25, (C, 3)); Tone (0.25, (E, 3), 60);
     Stop (0.5, (E, 3)); Tone (0., (C, 3), 60)]

Now, we transpose it and shift the start forward by a quarter note: *)
  
let melody2 = shift_start 0.25
                          (transpose melody1 7) ;;

(* The result is a stream that begins as

s    # NLS.first 5 melody2 ;;
    - : event list =
    [Tone (0.25, (G, 3), 60); Stop (0.25, (G, 3)); Tone (0.25, (B, 3), 60);
     Stop (0.5, (B, 3)); Tone (0., (G, 3), 60)]

Finally, combine the two as a harmony: *)
  
let harmony = pair melody1 melody2 ;;

(* The result begins like this:

    # NLS.first 10 harmony ;;
    - : event list =
    [Tone (0., (C, 3), 60); Tone (0.25, (G, 3), 60); Stop (0., (C, 3));
     Stop (0.25, (G, 3)); Tone (0., (E, 3), 60); Tone (0.25, (B, 3), 60);
     Stop (0.25, (E, 3)); Tone (0., (C, 3), 60); Stop (0.25, (B, 3));
     Tone (0., (G, 3), 60)]

You can write this out as a midi file and listen to it. *)
                              
let _ = output_midi "temp.mid" (stream_to_hex 16 harmony) ;;
   
   (* <----- END OF SECTION TO UNCOMMENT. *)
   
(*......................................................................
The next example combines some scales. Uncomment these lines when you're
done implementing the functions above. You can listen
to it by opening the file "scale.mid". *)


let scale1 = list_to_stream (List.map quarter
                                      [(C,3); (D,3); (E,3); (F,3); 
                                       (G,3); (A,3); (B,3); (C,4)]) ;;

let scale2 = transpose scale1 7 ;; 

let scales = pair scale1 scale2 ;;

Problem 3.4: Then with just three lists provided after this comment and
the functions we defined, produce (a small part of) a great piece of
music. The piece should be four streams merged: one should be the bass
playing continuously from the beginning. The other three should be the
melody, starting 2, 4, and 6 measures from the beginning,
respectively.

Define a stream `canon` here using the above component
streams `bass` and `melody`. Uncomment the definitions above and the
lines below when you're done. Run the program and open "canon.mid" to
hear the beautiful music.

(*......................................................................
Problem 3.5: Challenge problem. There's lots of opportunity for
extending your system. If you want, try implementing other functions
for manipulating event streams. Maybe one that increases or decreases
the timescale, or one that doubles every note, or increases or
decreases the volume. See what kind of music you can create. We've
given you some more interesting streams of music to play around with
if you'd like, named `part1` through `part4`. They're all the same
length, 2.25 measures. Try overlaying them all and outputting it as a
midi file. Or just make your own music streams here.
